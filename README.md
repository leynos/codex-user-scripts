# Codex User Scripts

This repository contains a collection of user scripts designed to enhance and streamline the user experience on Codex and GitHub. They add helpful UI elements, automate repetitive tasks, and provide at-a-glance information to make your workflow more efficient.

## Scripts

### `codex-ctrl-enter-code.js`

- **Functionality**: This script provides a quality-of-life improvement by allowing you to submit prompts in the Codex interface using the `Ctrl+Enter` keyboard shortcut.

- **Target Pages**: It runs on the main Codex page and any task-specific pages (`https://chatgpt.com/codex*`).

### `codex-environment-viewer.js`

- **Functionality**: This script captures and displays your Codex environment configurations. It adds a "🚀 View Environments" button to the page. Clicking this button opens a modal that lists all your environments and allows you to copy their IDs individually or copy the entire configuration as a JSON blob, which is useful for the `github-to-codex-linker.js` script. The script automatically activates only on the environment settings page and unloads on other pages.

- **Target Page**: `https://chatgpt.com/codex/settings/environments`

### `codex-task-badger.js`

- **Functionality**: This script adds a status emoji to the browser tab's title on a Codex task page, providing an immediate visual indicator of the task's state:

  - `✅️` (Success): Appears when an "Update branch" or "Create PR" button is available.

  - `😵` (Error): Appears if a "Failed in..." error banner is displayed.

  - `🏗️` (Working): Appears when a task is actively being processed.

- **Target Page**: `https://chatgpt.com/codex/tasks*`

### `codex-task-environment-titler.js`

- **Functionality**: To make it easier to distinguish between different browser tabs, this script appends the name of the active Codex environment to the page title, formatted as `[Environment Name]`.

- **Target Page**: `https://chatgpt.com/codex/tasks*`

### `github-actions-failed-step-log-copier.js`

- **Functionality**: When a GitHub Actions workflow fails, this script adds a "View/Copy Log" button to the failed step. Because logs are often virtualized and load dynamically as you scroll, this script uses a `MutationObserver` to capture and cache all log lines. Clicking the button opens a modal where you can view the complete, aggregated log and copy it to your clipboard.

- **Target Page**: `https://github.com/*/*/actions/runs/*`

### `github-pull-request-badger.js`

- **Functionality**: This script adds emoji badges to the title of GitHub pull request pages to provide a quick visual summary of the PR's status. Badges include:

  - `🐇`: CodeRabbit is processing changes.

  - `‼️`: Checks are failing.

  - `🚧`: The branch has merge conflicts.

  - `💬`: There are unresolved review comments.

  - `💎`: The pull request has been merged.

  - `⏱️`: A CodeRabbit rate limit is active.

  - `🚫`: The pull request is closed without being merged.

- **Target Page**: `https://github.com/*/*/pull/*`

### `github-to-codex-linker.js`

- **Functionality**: This script bridges the gap between GitHub and Codex. It adds a "Work in Codex" button to the sidebar of a pull request page. To use it, you must first import your environment data using the settings icon (⚙️) which opens a modal to paste the JSON data from the `codex-environment-viewer.js` script. Once configured, the script automatically finds the correct Codex environment corresponding to the PR's repository and creates a direct link to open the PR's branch in that environment.

- **Target Page**: `https://github.com/*/*/pull/*`
